Rust to MapReduce
=========

![RustLogo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rtm9zc/Rust-Pages/gh-pages/rust-logo.png)Welcome to Rust to MapReduce!

Rust, in the words of the developers, is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents almost all crashes, and eliminates data races. These characteristics make it perfect for usage in large, cocurrent systems that are so prevelant in today's computing world.

We'll be starting you off with basic Rust syntax, before moving through Rust's pointers, data structures, concurrency, part of the standard library, and the rest of the language. The end goal is to be able to produce a [MapReduce](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce) program in Rust.
